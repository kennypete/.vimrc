# .vimrc
This is my .vimrc, kept updated. Vim will read a .vimrc symbolic link, so the easiest means to ensure a clean local repository is to have a "~/vimrc" folder (i.e., in the same location as the .vimrc used by Vim).

## sections
I have split my .vimrc into sections:

01: The default .vimrc file from B. Moolenaar, copied verbatim + modified where commented
02: Various additions from different sources (as noted)
03: Functions
04: vimplug
05: to 10: [Future - perhaps splitting out 03]
11: Airline (i.e., airline plugin) settings/overrides
12: The python-mode (i.e., pymode plugin) additions

## other Vim notes / random stuff
There are numerous learnings on Vim all the time. I continue to record those in https://github.com/kennypete/md/blob/main/vim.md and will migrate relevant content into the .vimrc when worthwhile.
