# .vimrc
This is my .vimrc, kept updated. Vim will read a .vimrc symbolic link, so the easiest means to ensure a clean local repository is to have a "vimrc" folder in the same location as the .vimrc used by Vim.

## sections
I have split my .vimrc into sections:
1. The default .vimrc file from B. Moolenaar, copied verbatim + modified where commented
2. Some random additions from different sources (as noted)
3. The python-mode (i.e., pymode plugin) additions
4. Functions
5. Airline (i.e., airline plugin) settings/overrides
6. Commenting code

[Details to follow?]

## other Vim notes / random stuff
There are numerous learnings on Vim all the time. I will migrate those from Notabiity to here and keep updating them - some may find their way into the .vimrc if relevant to a task.
